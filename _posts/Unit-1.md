#Counting and sets

The set of items we're interested in, and how we determine the size of that set, are critical for determining the probability that various observations occur. 

Statistical inferences rest on probability models, which describe how likely particular outcomes are to occur.  We start this course with a look at how those outcomes can be enumerated.  

The purpose of doing this is three-fold. First, I want you to have some sense of how you might enumerate the sample space associated with a particular ecological question.  Second, I want you to have a passing familiarity with counting processes, as these do come up in many different kinds of ecological problems, and also in study design. Third, I want you to have a conceptual grasp of how many different ways particular kinds of patterns can emerge.
